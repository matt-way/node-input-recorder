# node-input-recorder
Native background mouse and keyboard recording for node.js (electron)

This is currently an initial work in progress, and only has basic functionality for osx. It will eventually be implemented for other platforms, with the functionality improved. For now it captures all key presses, and captures left + right mouse button interactions.
